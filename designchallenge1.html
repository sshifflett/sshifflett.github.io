	<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>
	<p>I was insired by <a href="http://brightbyte.co.uk/" target="_blank">BrightByte Studio</a> and <a href="http://wearecuppa.com/" target="_blank">We Are Cuppa</a>.</p>
	<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>
	<p>Both similar in their use of a hero image to learn more about their work, with similar visual hierarchy. They both have a great balance in their use of space and size.</p>
	<h1>What makes them similiar and different?</h1>
	<p>Personally, I prefer the lightness of <em>We Are Cuppa</em>, but prefer <em>Brightbyte Studio</em>’s segmentation of the one page scroll. I like when the navigation goes with you as you scroll down the page, like it does on the <em>BrightByte Studio</em>’s does, but I believe the compactness of the other site is ok without it.</p>
