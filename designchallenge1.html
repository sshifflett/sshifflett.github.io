	<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>
	<p>I was insired by <a href="http://brightbyte.co.uk/" target="_blank">BrightByte Studio</a> and <a href="http://wearecuppa.com/" target="_blank">We Are Cuppa</a>.</p>
	<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>
	<p>Both similar in their use of a hero image to learn more about their work, with similar visual hierarchy. They both have a great balance in their use of space and size.</p>
	<h1>What makes them similiar and different?</h1>
	<p>Personally, I prefer the lightness of <em>We Are Cuppa</em>, but prefer <em>Brightbyte Studio</em>’s segmentation of the one page scroll. I like when the navigation goes with you as you scroll down the page, like it does on the <em>BrightByte Studio</em>’s does, but I believe the compactness of the other site is ok without it.</p>
	<h1>Thumbnail Sketches</h1>
	<ul
		<li><strong>Homepage Layout #1</strong><br /><img src="https://db.tt/9vHY6zwb"><br /><p>With this layout my work is featured from the very start with a rotating carousel. The navigation here is modeled after We Are Cuppa, with it at the top and the logo in the middle.</p></li>
		<li><strong>Homepage Layout #2</strong><br /><img src="https://db.tt/buKEwdYr"><br /><p>With this layout the novigation is overlayed on the banner image. The rest of the site is broken down by section and will be a one page scroll, with my work being featured after they learn a little more about me and the services I offer. I personally prefer option #2.</p></li>
